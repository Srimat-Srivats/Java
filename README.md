## Introduction
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are the backbone of computer science and software engineering. They are essential tools for solving complex problems and optimizing performance.

## Data Structures
### Arrays
- Description: Arrays are a collection of elements, each identified by an index.
- Implementation: [Array Implementation]
- Applications: Used for storing data in a linear fashion.

### Linked Lists
- Description: Linked Lists are a collection of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node.
- Implementation: [Linked List Implementation]
- Applications: Useful for dynamic memory allocation.

### Stacks
- Description: Stacks follow a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
- Implementation: [Stack Implementation]
- Applications: Used for function call management, expression evaluation, etc.

### Queues
- Description: Queues follow a First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
- Implementation: [Queue Implementation]
- Applications: Used in scheduling, buffering, etc.

### Trees
- Description: Trees are hierarchical data structures with nodes connected by edges.
- Implementation: [Tree Implementation]
- Applications: Used for representing hierarchical data.

### Graphs
- Description: Graphs are collections of nodes connected by edges, used to represent networks.
- Implementation: [Graph Implementation]
- Applications: Used in networking, social networks, etc.

## Algorithms
### Sorting
- Description: Algorithms for arranging elements in a particular order.
- Examples: [Sorting Algorithms]

### Searching
- Description: Algorithms for finding an element in a collection.
- Examples: [Searching Algorithms]

### Dynamic Programming
- Description: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
- Examples: [Dynamic Programming Algorithms]

### Graph Algorithms
- Description: Algorithms for traversing and manipulating graphs.
- Examples: [Graph Algorithms]
